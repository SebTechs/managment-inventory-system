# Managment Inventory System v0.01

This is meant to create a managment system with it's main feature being a inventory system. It's not meant for large scale business use but personal use like managing items at home.

## To do

- Connect to a mysql database running locally (I'll be using phpmyadmin)
- Ability to log in and have password securely stored on database (using salted hashing)
- Ability to reset password using an email.
- Ability to get the username shown to user if email has been forgotten.
- Ability to create new records (items in inventory)
- Ability to modify existing records and archieve items
- Items should only be able to be deleted if first archeived and should warn the user.
- Ability to search  the database of items.
- Ability to filter the search if needed.
- Code must be robust and efficient.
- Ability to be able to add images to database and make sure they are not accessible if user is not logged in.
- Ability to create labels on the website with a 2D barcode for 2D scanners and/or (option to chose) a QR code if a user want to use their phone as a scanner.
- Ability to be able to print from the website to a barcode printer
- Ability to be able to change the size of the label and use premade templates.

And many more that I'll add as I remember them
