    <h1>Terms of use / Terms and condition</h1>
    <p>The pirmary developer of this piece of software and tool is sebsnetwork or SebTechs on github. This project is completely open source and is free to be edited by anyone. 
        If this program is downloaded from an external source it has the potensial for the information to be stolen and it's important that this code is downloaded directly from github the only place where this code is distrubted from currently (26.06.2023).
        If this program is downloaded from a diffrent source than github and there is a data breach, you agree that we are not liable for this.
    </p>
    <p>Information inputed and uploaded to the databases will only be stored locally on your local hardware and at no point unless permitted by you, is it ever sent anywhere else. This program may occasionally call home if that feature is enabled to for example warn the user of a update that could be installed. And any features that could have been realeased.</p>
    <p>This program does use coockies on the user PC for the remember me feature to make sure that the user stays logged in the next time they enter the website and that they don't need to reenter their password. Password will still need to be required when doing bigger stuff on the database and will be required the first time when running a custom query.</p>
    <p>In the future there may be an option to use custom scripts made by you to run automation on your database. You agree that we are not liable for any data loss in the event that a script doesn't do what it's intended purpose was or it bricks the program.</p>
